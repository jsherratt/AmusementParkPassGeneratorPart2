# AmusementParkPassGeneratorPart2
Amusement park pass generator for iPad: Part 2

You will now take the code you created in Amusement Park Generator: Part 1 and add User Interface, along with a short list of new features and entrant types. These changes may force you to refactor some code in order to accommodate them.

Upon completion, you will have an app, created entirely yourself, which can take user input, create personalized entrant passes for a variety of entrant types as well as test their “swipe-ability” at various locations.
